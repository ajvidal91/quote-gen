# My Awesome Project
This is an app in which you click a button and a quote will appear as well, as a photo
of a Rick & Morty character to go along with the quote.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
I used basic HTML along with JavaScript, and two API'S.


## Lessons Learned:

This one was a little tricky, and had to include some thinking outside of the box
(in this case thinking inside) and figured how to successfully loop thru the array
in my ajax request
